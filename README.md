# Attention Group Hackathon
## Overview

This repository contains the beginnings of a hackathon brainstorm for the EPSCoR graduate students at the [2018 meeting at Brown University](https://www.attentioninthebrain.com/2018-annual-epscor-attention-consortium-conference/).

## Contributing ideas to this project

To contribute you need write access to this repo.  Please go to the [GitHub signup page](https://github.com/join) to get an account (if you don't already have one).  Then post your username on the [hackathon Slack channel](https://attention-group.slack.com/messages/CBQE2KP7E) to be added to the project.

To add your ideas, please [post an issue](https://github.com/ContextLab/AttentionGroupHackathon/issues) with the following information:
- A *clear title* that describes in very brief summary form what you're proposing
- A slightly expanded (1-2 paragraph) summary of your idea
- A set of bullet points with any specific goals or tasks
- If applicable, links to other related projects, papers, figures, sketches, etc.

## How can I contribute if I can't code?

If you can't code, you can contribute in (at least) three possible ways:
- You can learn to code!  [Here](https://github.com/ContextLab/storytelling-with-data) are some links to tutorials that provide a nice play to start.
- You can contribute ideas by adding issues, commenting on existing code/aspects of this repository, etc.
- You can [pair program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming) with another contributor to the project.  This may entail pairing up with one or more experienced coder(s) at your home institution or a remote institution.
